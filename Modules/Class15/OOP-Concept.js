/**
 * OOP Concept (OOP -> Object Oriented Programming)
 * 
 * 1. Encapsulation
 *      Wrapping up code in a class
 *      To implement the Encapsulation concept, we create Class and write code in it.
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Abstraction
 *      Hiding unnecessary information from user.
 *      To implement Abstraction concept, we create methods/functions
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Inheritance
 *      -> To implement Inheritance, we need to have parent-child set up between two classes.
 *      -> we use "extends" keyword with childClass, in to order to create parent-child relation between two classes
 *      -> childClass gets access to parentClass/grandParentClass variables and functions (except the private variables and functions in parent/grandParent class)
 *      -> a class can extend ONLY one class (why? - Diamond Problem)
 * 
 * 
 * 4. Polymorphism
